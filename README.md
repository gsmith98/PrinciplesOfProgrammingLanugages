Coursework for PL

This is a collection of all the work done for the Fall 2016 Principles of Programming Languages Course taught at JHU by Scott Smith (current site here: http://pl.cs.jhu.edu/pl/index.shtml).

This work was originally done in Eclipse with an OCaml plugin. As such there are a bunch of garbage eclipse files floating around. Most likely the .ml files will be the most interesting, those were the ones written directly by me.

The earlier assignments focus more on coding and the later ones more on theory. If you're looking just for classic OCaml code, try GWShw1Answers.ml.
